Create a digital video based classroom in WordPress. This plugin gives you the ability to publish classes. It's flexible enough to combine with other well known WordPress plugins to enhance the functionality.

Want to sell your courses? Sell access to them with:
- [WooCommerce](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/)
- [Groups for WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/products/groups-woocommerce/)

- [WP Term Images](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-term-images/)
- [WP Term Order](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-term-order/)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `classroom` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Usage ==

Most of the time, you'll want to sell private access to your classes. This can be accomplished by installing [Groups](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/groups/) and [WooCommerce](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/).

Once installed, you can restrict access on a class or course basis by assigning them to a Group. Then, simply create a product and designate which Group they should be added to after purchase.

== Customization ==

This plugin was made to be particularly customizable and not too opinionated. To customize the class design, copy the `templates/single.php` to your theme's directory in `classroom/single.php`. From there, you can customize the output.
